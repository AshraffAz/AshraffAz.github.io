## Features

- **Port Selection:** Users can select from a list of ports in East Malaysia as their origin and destination points.
- **Shipping Rate Visualization:** Displays shipping rates based on the selected origin and destination.
- **Distance Calculation:** Calculates and displays the distance between the selected origin and destination.
- **Google Search Integration:** Offers a Google search result for locations not available in the database, ensuring users can still find necessary information.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
